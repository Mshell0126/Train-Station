# Train-Station

Included with the source files is a java docs folder with explanations on all the classes and methods.
This was a project for Data Structures and Algorithms.
The goal was to simulate a train station circuit where passengers arrive at stations and get in line to board the train.
Each passenger has a target destination and at each stop, the train docks passengers who
intend to get off at the current stop and board as many passengers as will fit in the remaining seats after
docking passengers. A report should print for every set of laps the train makes.
