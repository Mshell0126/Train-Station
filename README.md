# Train-Station

Included is a java docs folder with explanations on all the classes and methods.
This was a project for Data Structures and Algorithms.
The goal was to simulate a train station where passengers arrive and get in line to board.
Each passenger has a target destination and at each stop, the train docks passengers who
intend to get off at the current stop and board as many passengers as there are seats for after
docking. A report should print for every set of laps the train makes.
